      <p>	I'm an only child and grew up in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Brooklyn with my parents. Living in this neighborhood gave me benefits, however, such as access to my father's side of the family. With them living only 10 minutes away from our house, every weekend was spent on the other side of my hood with relatives. The other side was an entirely different world I experienced in comparison to the one I normally live in.
	When I think of my childhood in Brooklyn, I'm reminded of East Flatbush just outside of the little Caribbean and little Haiti. My Jamaican side lived all over this place. The major cultural difference between my neighborhood and this one was so great, I always favored my Aunt's house more. My house is a small 3 room one-floor apartment with a black and white theme. It feels so uniform and too organized so it was always nice for a change of scenery. On the way to my aunt's, we passed a long strip of concrete strip malls with fast food options on every block. Past the Kings Plaza where we would all go as a family to get auntie Anne's pretzels or fresh baked cookies that left us smelling like macadamia nuts and white chocolate. Around the corner from the 7/11 store, my cousins and I would bike to every summer to pump our wheels or to get abnormally large blue slushies mixed with coke and sprite. Finally on the suburbia block, on the way was always the cramped and dimly lit deli with the "ock" or owner who watched us all grow up eating his ice or buying cheap plastic water guns and water balloons every summer. My neighborhood is past Pitkin ave where old men gather out the rite aid to stand all day and yell at people who pass. The floor is not only littered with bags and bags of trash and food thrown all over the place; the cigarette butts trail up and down the gutters and the overwhelming smell of the grease fires from the McDonalds across the street keeps me away from walking up that block. Across the street from me is a police station and right behind it is the juvie where someone from my summer camp has been from 2019 to now. My neighborhood leaves me with scary memories of being followed by the zombies that stand and gather on the block by my bus stop or almost getting jumped by girls outside of my train station on the way home from school. Even my dog running away twice, running for his life up and down the traffic-filled streets stays in the back of my head in the vault of bad experiences. East Flatbush fills the home and fuzzy memory vault of me and my cousins walking to the king's plaza hospital to get vending machine snacks in my Aunt's nurse's office waiting for her to get off work to take us to get spicy wendy's nuggets. 
	Growing up in the hood of Little Caribbean with the busy streets, old ladies' carts full of laundry and groceries, the markets of fruit sitting outside next to the jumbo light-up speakers blasting a rasta tune, and the fish markets smell that carried over people's heads for blocks made me into the person I am today. Walking in the suburbia of east Flatbush housing was like walking through another city for me. The drive-in lots next to the two-story houses felt so different from my 3 story apartment sitting next to a parking lot, isolated on a corner next to other tall apartments. The barbershop a few steps from my Aunt's house would cut my cousin's hair so they were familiar with the family. Almost everyone in the neighborhood would know my dad's side. The people at the family dollar recognized us from our constant visits to get large bags of candy to watch horror movies every Saturday and on the way walking back we always ran into my cousin's friends from their past schools in the neighborhood. The kid that lived on the end of the block was 18 when we were 13, 14, and 16. He would meet up with us at the park of the abandoned middle school next to a bus stop. Although he towered over us and told stories of his dangerous school and the people in it threatening him every other day, he was a big part of the community. East Flatbush and near Schenectady had a small community of families interacting with one another. I remember a kid who was 3 years younger than I would always come across the street to bike with us, play basketball, or just grab a plate if we had our annual barbeques. The bass booming seemed to drag people from all over, no matter if they were family or not, they joined in to dance and laugh. I always label Little Haiti and the Caribbean as the family hub of my childhood where I made the most friendships and had life-changing experiences.
The connection between Brownsville and East Flatbush brought my two cousins and I to  a sibling-like relationship. Spending my weekend with them every week, they both filled in the sibling role in my only child life. One is only a year ahead of me and the other is two years. I would have sleepovers and they made my neighborhood less alone  throughout my childhood. Living so close to each other we have seen each other grow into adults and mature in so many ways. I will always miss biking with them and picking each other up from drum and violin practice from just around the corner. Both our houses underwent renovations while our goals changed as well. One of my cousin's joined ROTC, went into professional biking around different cities, has 4 jobs, and is listed to join the marines. The oldest went from being a beauty pageant star to being more herself, getting a job and pursuing drums. Me being the baby, I grew both mentally from the skinny timid and quiet one to a slightly taller skinny timid and quiet one. Brooklyn raised us all into different people, shaped our bond to become even stronger with age, and kept us all together.
